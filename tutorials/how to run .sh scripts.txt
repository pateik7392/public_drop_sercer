On Windows:
1. Install a Bash emulator like Git Bash.
2. Open the Bash emulator.
3. Navigate to the directory containing your Bash script using the cd command.
4. Run the script using the following command: bash your_script.sh

On Ubuntu:
1. Open the terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing your Bash script using the cd command.
3. Run the script using the following command: ./your_script.sh

Make sure to replace your_script.sh with the actual name of your script. If the script is not executable, you might need to provide execute permissions using chmod +x your_script.sh on Ubuntu.
